    <title>OOPS! NO RED FLUORESCENCE!</title>
    <subtitle>This door requires red light to be opened.</subtitle>
    <texture>t_rfp_needed</texture>
    <explanation>Your bacterium cannot open this door because it doesn't glow red. It needs to produce a red fluorescence protein (RFP) that glows red when exposed to green light.</explanation>
